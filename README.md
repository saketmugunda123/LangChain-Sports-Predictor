# LangChain-Sports-Predictor
Uses LangChain to connect AI agents to predict the outcomes of sports games
One agent creates a vector DB from vector embeddings that stores the relevant statistical and qualitative information about the match.
The other agent is an Open AI model that pulls from the vector DB and outputs an answer based on the statistical data.
